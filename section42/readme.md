Unfortunetly by the time I follow this tutorial, negroni-sessions is not compatible with master branch of codegangsta/negroni, from github page it only compatible with urfave negroni fork. 

``` 
  "github.com/urfave/negroni"
  "github.com/goincremental/negroni-sessions"
  "github.com/goincremental/negroni-sessions/cookiestore"
```  

So I remark all negroni-session code. Other sort code is working fine.
